It's been a while since the last time I tried to make a web app, so to avoid being too rusty I decided to made this simple project. The app works simply, it's a calculator that can only holds 2 numbers. So, if you input "1" as your first number then press an operator like "+" then input "2" as your second number then press another operator like "+" then input another number like "3", the result will be "5" because the first number got replaced over.

Although crude and clunky, in all honesty I think it is a good enough warm up for me on the basics of web app development. Though I really need to start using HTML5 with all their specified tags instead of classing divs.

How to Use?

Well, it's a simple basic web app really, just clone the repo and double click the HTML file, it should work just fine.
